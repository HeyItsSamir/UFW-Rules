TODO
----
improve manpage with talk of *.rules

update sysctl.conf with ipv6

add commented out ip_forward line to sysctl.conf

separate out backend and frontend code and put into /usr/share

implement /var/lib/ufw/maps

Provide a way out if it doesn't work (eg prompt user for 'Did it work?' type
question, and timeout if no response (maybe use the previous working policy?))
