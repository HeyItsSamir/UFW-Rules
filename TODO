TODO
----
Output of machine-friendly status (adjust backend_iptables.py to return this
to frontend, and have frontend do cli/machine status)

Support insertion of rules (LP: #260745). Perhaps 'ufw insert as 5 allow ...'

Simplify initscript and break rules setup into a helper program

Detect version of ip6tables and warn that application profiles are not
supported for ip6tables < 1.4

ufw status raw (iptables -L -n...)

Stablize API for programming frontends

DBus support so frontend can send messages to ufw which can then be protected
via policy kit
