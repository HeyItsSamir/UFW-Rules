Output of machine-friendly status (adjust backend_iptables.py to return this
to frontend, and have frontend do cli/machine status)

Support insertion of rules (LP: #260745). Perhaps 'ufw insert as 5 allow ...'

Simplify initscript and break rules setup into a helper program

Detect version of ip6tables and warn that application profiles are not
supported for ip6tables < 1.4
