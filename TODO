more test scripts

finish _doChecks() 

separate out backend and frontend code and put into /usr/share
Backend cleanup and configure in /etc/defaults/ufw
make rules file configurable in /etc/defaults/ufw (eg IPT_RULES)

implement default ACCEPT policy and 'ufw default allow|deny'

implement /etc/ufw/maps
ufw <service> allow|deny [ip or network]
ufw status should be much cleaner than iptables dump

sysctl/proc support

Provide a way out if it doesn't work (eg prompt user for 'Did it work?' type
question, and timeout if no response (maybe use the previous working policy?))

IDEAS:
section off the different areas that the tool will touch

Eg:
# ufwPolicyStart -- DO NOT DELETE THIS COMMENT
*filter
:INPUT DROP [0:0]
:FORWARD DROP [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:drop-not-to-me - [0:0]
# ufwPolicyEnd -- DO NOT DELETE THIS COMMENT

# ufwFixedStart -- DO NOT DELETE THIS COMMENT
-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j LOG
-A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP
...
# ufwFixedEnd -- DO NOT DELETE THIS COMMENT

# ufwUserStart -- DO NOT DELETE THIS COMMENT
... rules added with 'ufw <service> allow|deny'
# ufwUserEnd -- DO NOT DELETE THIS COMMENT

# ufwCustomStart -- DO NOT DELETE THIS COMMENT
# Any rules in this section will not be touched by ufw
#
...
#
# ufwCustomEnd -- DO NOT DELETE THIS COMMENT
#

# DO NOT DELETE THE BELOW LINE
COMMIT


For maximum flexibility, should allow custom comments to appear anywhere
