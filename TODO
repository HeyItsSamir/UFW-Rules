TODO
----
man page

separate out backend and frontend code and put into /usr/share
Backend cleanup and configure in /etc/defaults/ufw
make rules file configurable in /etc/defaults/ufw (eg IPT_RULES)

implement default ACCEPT policy and 'ufw default allow|deny'

implement /etc/ufw/maps
ufw <service> allow|deny [ip or network]
ufw status should be much cleaner than iptables dump

sysctl/proc support

Provide a way out if it doesn't work (eg prompt user for 'Did it work?' type
question, and timeout if no response (maybe use the previous working policy?))
