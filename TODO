TODO
----
DBus support so frontend can send messages to ufw which can then be protected
via policy kit

Provide a very simple GUI, possibly with NetworkManager integration. This GUI
would not replace gufw, which aims to expose the full functionality of ufw.

MAC address filtering (ie ebtables)

nftables backend (long term)

Support IPv6 6to4 tunnels (LP: #502655)
