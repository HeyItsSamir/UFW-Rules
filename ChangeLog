ufw (0.29) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * add egress filtering support:
    - CLI command allows specifying direction in simple and extended syntax
    - status reporting shows outgoing policy and outgoing rules
    - allow changing default outgoing policy
    - connection tracking for outgoing packets is now put in its own chain,
      rather than configured in before*.rules
    - DEFAULT_OUTPUT_POLICY can now also be set to ACCEPT_NO_CONNTRACK
    - update documentation for the above

ufw (0.28) RELEASED; urgency=low

  * translation fixes
  * add interface rules
  * update Makefile to fail if byte-compiling failed
  * install rules files 0640 (LP: #393187)
  * adjust help command for proper translation and bash completion support
  * add limit command to help (LP: #358964)
  * add shell-completion/bash. Based on work by Didier Roche
  * tests/*: updated with 'nostats' option so redundant tests are counted
    in test results. Update many root tests to use 'nostats'
  * look for location of iptables and set IPTABLES_DIR in common.py. Adjust
    calls to ip[6]tables* to use IPTABLES_DIR
  * fix harmless but annoying bug where multi-rule application rules ended
    up with ::/0 in the tuple line in user.rules (IPV4) when not specifying a
    destination or source address and IPV6 is enabled
  * make insert rule logic more robust
  * update setup.py to install user rules and init script helpers into
    /lib, rather than /var/lib and /usr/share/ufw. Update tests,
    backend_iptables.py, ufw-init and documentation accordingly. (LP: #400208)

ufw (0.27) RELEASED; urgency=low

  * don't do symlink check anymore (LP: #317700)
  * don't do hidden file check anymore (LP: #319226). Hidden application
    profiles are already skipped, so this check only bumps into revision
    control systems
  * add 'status numbered' command
  * more comments in conf/sysctl.conf
  * add insert rule support (LP: #260745)
  * read in rules from /var/lib/ufw/*.rules. This helps keep status inline
    with reality and fixes (LP: #262975)
  * add loglevel support. This also changed the default rules files
  * add per rule logging support
  * get rid of redundant RETURN rules
  * update LIMIT logging prefix
  * update setup.py to use subprocess instead of Popen3

  * add runtime version check for iptables and warn if using IPv6 application
    rules with iptables < 1.4
  * Makefile: depend on translations when making tarball
  * remove more useless newlines
  * man page updates
  * display interfaces and exact packet counters in 'status raw'
  * support REJECT for rules, default policy and default application policy
    (LP: #197322)
  * only flush and delete ufw chains
  * add a 'flush-all' command to ufw-init
  * add MANAGE_BUILTINS option to /etc/default/ufw, and when set to 'yes'
    flush the built-in chains too

  * new ChangeLog files for upstream tarballs. See ChangeLog.pre-0.25 for
    previous changes, including Ubuntu-specific changes
  * setup.py: don't install initscript anymore
  * add example (non-LSB) initscript to doc/initscript.example
  * split out initscript into ufw-init-functions, ufw-init (for use by
    ufw itself) and doc/initscript.example (for use by distributions). This
    makes ufw more robust and portable
  * don't stop the firewall via the initscripts if ufw is not enabled
    (LP: #311066)
  * rename skel-ui to skel-ui.example
  * README:
    - add Distributions section
    - update for initscript changes
    - update What's in a Name
