ufw (0.25) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * new ChangeLog files for upstream tarballs. See ChangeLog.pre-0.25 for
    previous changes, including Ubuntu-specific changes
  * split out initscript into ufw-init-functions, ufw-init (for use by
    ufw itself) and conf/initscript (for use by distributions). This makes ufw
    more robust and portable
  * don't stop the firewall via the initscripts if ufw is not enabled
    (LP: #311066)
