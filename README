Basic Layout
------------
/usr/sbin/fw 			is the UI for people (have different backends)
/etc/defaults/fw 		high level configuration
/etc/fw/fw.rules 		for iptables-restore backend
/etc/network/if-up.d/fw		integration into boot	

Beginning implementation:
fw enable|disable 		disable toggles /etc/default/fw
fw logging on|off		updates backend logging (fw.rules)
fw status			displays firewall status (start with ipt -Ln)
fw stats			displays statistics (TODO)


Language
--------
Because networking comes up after mounts, we can use python, and do. :)
