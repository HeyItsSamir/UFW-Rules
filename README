UFW

What's in a name?
-----------------
What does it mean?  Nothing, or rather, it's up to you. :)  If you like it,
you might pick 'Universal Firewall', 'Ultimate Firewall', 'Uncomplicated
Firewall', or considering it current state, 'Unfinished Firewall'. If you are
not a fan, perhaps 'Unbearable Firewall'.


Install
-------
For now, it is manual.  See the files in 'Basic Layout' and copy them over,
adjusting /usr/sbin/ufw to point to where you put the files.


Basic Layout
------------
/usr/sbin/ufw 			is the UI for people (have different backends)
/etc/defaults/ufw 		high level configuration
/etc/ufw/ufw.rules 		for iptables-restore backend
/etc/network/if-up.d/ufw	integration into boot	


Usage
-----
ufw enable|disable 		disable toggles /etc/default/ufw
ufw logging on|off		updates backend logging (ufw.rules)
ufw status			displays firewall status (start with ipt -Ln)
ufw stats			displays statistics (TODO)
