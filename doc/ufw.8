.SH "RULE SYNTAX"
.PP
Users can specify rules using either a simple syntax or a full syntax. The
simple syntax only specifies the port and optionally the protocol to be
allowed or denied on the host. For example:

  ufw allow 53

This rule will allow tcp and udp port 53 to any address on this host. To
specify a protocol, append '/protocol' to the port. For example:

  ufw allow 25/tcp

This will allow tcp port 25 to any address on this host. \fBufw\fR will also
check /etc/services for the port and protocol if specifying a service by name.
Eg:

  ufw allow smtp

\fBufw\fR supports both ingress and egress filtering and users may optionally
specify a direction of either \fBin\fR or \fBout\fR for either incoming or
outgoing traffic. If no direction is supplied, the rule applies to incoming
traffic. Eg:

  ufw allow in http
  ufw reject out smtp
.PP
Users can also use a fuller syntax, specifying the source and destination
addresses and ports. This syntax is based on OpenBSD's PF syntax. For example:

  ufw deny proto tcp to any port 80

This will deny all traffic to tcp port 80 on this host. Another example:

  ufw deny proto tcp from 10.0.0.0/8 to 192.168.0.1 port 25

This will deny all traffic from the RFC1918 Class A network to tcp port 25
with the address 192.168.0.1.

  ufw deny proto tcp from 2001:db8::/32 to any port 25

This will deny all traffic from the IPv6 2001:db8::/32 to tcp port 25 on this
host. Note that IPv6 must be enabled in #CONFIG_PREFIX#/default/ufw for IPv6
firewalling to work.

  ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 80,443,8080:8090

This will allow all traffic to tcp ports 80, 443 and 8080\-8090 inclusive. Note
that when specifying multiple ports, the ports list must be numeric, cannot
contain spaces and must be modified as a whole. Eg, in the above example you
cannot later try to delete just the '443' port. You cannot specify more than 15
ports (ranges count as 2 ports, so the port count in the above example is 4).
.PP
\fBufw\fR supports connection rate limiting, which is useful for protecting
against brute-force login attacks. \fBufw\fR will deny connections if an IP
address has attempted to initiate 6 or more connections in the last 30 seconds.
See http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/187 for details.  Typical
usage is:

  ufw limit ssh/tcp

.PP
Sometimes it is desirable to let the sender know when traffic is being
denied, rather than simply ignoring it. In these cases, use \fBreject\fR
instead of \fBdeny\fR.  For example:

  ufw reject auth

.PP
By default, \fBufw\fR will apply rules to all available interfaces. To limit
this, specify \fBDIRECTION on INTERFACE\fR, where DIRECTION is one of \fBin\fR
or \fBout\fR (interface aliases are not supported).  For example, to allow all
new incoming http connections on eth0, use:

  ufw allow in on eth0 to any port 80 proto tcp

.PP
To delete a rule, simply prefix the original rule with \fBdelete\fR. For
example, if the original rule was:

  ufw deny 80/tcp

Use this to delete it:

  ufw delete deny 80/tcp

.PP
To insert a rule, specify the new rule as normal, but prefix the rule with
the rule number to insert. For example, if you have four rules, and you want
to insert a new rule as rule number three, use:

  ufw insert 3 deny to any port 22 from 10.0.0.135 proto tcp

To see a list of numbered rules, use:

  ufw status numbered

.PP
\fBufw\fR supports per rule logging. By default, no logging is performed when
a packet matches a rule. Specifying \fBlog\fR will log all new connections
matching the rule, and \fBlog-all\fR will log all packets matching the rule.
For example, to allow and log all new ssh connections, use:

  ufw allow log 22/tcp

See \fBLOGGING\fR for more information on logging.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Deny all access to port 53:

  ufw deny 53

.PP
Allow all access to tcp port 80:

  ufw allow 80/tcp

.PP
Allow all access from RFC1918 networks to this host:

  ufw allow from 10.0.0.0/8
  ufw allow from 172.16.0.0/12
  ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16

.PP
Deny access to udp port 514 from host 1.2.3.4:

  ufw deny proto udp from 1.2.3.4 to any port 514

.PP
Allow access to udp 1.2.3.4 port 5469 from 1.2.3.5 port 5469:

  ufw allow proto udp from 1.2.3.5 port 5469 to 1.2.3.4 port 5469

.SH REMOTE MANAGEMENT
.PP
When running \fBufw enable\fR or starting \fBufw\fR via its initscript,
\fBufw\fR will flush its chains. This is required so \fBufw\fR can maintain a
consistent state, but it may drop existing connections (eg ssh). \fBufw\fR
does support adding rules before enabling the firewall, so administrators can
do:

  ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 22

before running '\fBufw enable\fR'. The rules will still be flushed, but the
ssh port will be open after enabling the firewall. Please note that once
ufw is 'enabled', \fBufw\fR will not flush the chains when adding or removing
rules (but will when modifying a rule or changing the default policy).

.SH APPLICATION INTEGRATION
.PP
\fBufw\fR supports application integration by reading profiles located in
#CONFIG_PREFIX#/ufw/applications.d. To list the names of application profiles
known to \fBufw\fR, use:

  ufw app list

Users can specify one of the applications names when adding rules. For example,
when using the simple syntax, users can use:

  ufw allow <name>

Or for the extended syntax:

  ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16 to any app <name>

You should not specify the protocol with either syntax, and with the extended
syntax, use \fBapp\fR in place of the \fBport\fR clause.

Details on the firewall profile for a given application can be seen with:

  ufw app info <name>

where '<name>' is one of the applications seen with the \fFapp list\fR command.
User's may also specify \fBall\fR to see the profiles for all known
applications.

After creating or editing an application profile, user's can run:

  ufw app update <name>

This command will automatically update the firewall with updated profile
information. If specify 'all' for name, then all the profiles will be updated.
To update a profile and add a new rule to the firewall automatically, user's
can run:

  ufw app update \-\-add\-new <name>

The behavior of the \fBupdate \-\-add\-new\fR command can be configured using:

  ufw app default <policy>

The default application policy is \fBskip\fR, which means that the \fBupdate
\-\-add\-new\fR command will do nothing. Users may also specify a policy of
\fBallow\fR or \fBdeny\fR so the \fBupdate \-\-add\-new\fR command may
automatically update the firewall.  \fBWARNING:\fR it may be a security to risk
to use a default \fBallow\fR policy for applications profiles. Carefully
consider the security ramifications before using a default \fBallow\fR policy.

.SH LOGGING
.PP
\fBufw\fR supports multiple logging levels. \fBufw\fR defaults to a loglevel
of 'low' when a loglevel is not specified. Users may specify a loglevel with:

  ufw logging LEVEL

LEVEL may be 'off', 'low', 'medium', 'high' and full. Log levels are defined
as:
.TP
\fBoff\fR
disables ufw managed logging
.TP
\fBlow\fR
logs all blocked packets not matching the default policy (with rate limiting),
as well as packets matching logged rules
.TP
\fBmedium\fR
log level low, plus all allowed packets not matching the default policy, all
INVALID packets, and all new connections.  All logging is done with rate
limiting.
.TP
\fBhigh\fR
log level medium (without rate limiting), plus all packets with rate limiting
.TP
\fBfull\fR
log level high without rate limiting

.PP
Loglevels above medium generate a lot of logging output, and may quickly fill
up your disk. Loglevel medium may generate a lot of logging output on a busy
system.
.PP
Specifying 'on' simply enables logging at log level 'low' if logging is
currently not enabled.

.SH NOTES
.PP
On installation, \fBufw\fR is disabled with a default incoming policy of deny
and a default outgoing policy of allow, with stateful tracking for NEW
connections. Having a default policy of allow without stateful tracking can be
achieved by using ACCEPT_NO_TRACK instead of ACCEPT in
#CONFIG_PREFIX#/defaults/ufw.

.PP
Rule ordering is important and the first match wins. Therefore when adding
rules, add the more specific rules first with more general rules later.
.PP
\fBufw\fR is not intended to provide complete firewall functionality via
its command interface, but instead provides an easy way to add or remove
simple rules. It is currently mainly used for host-based firewalls.
.PP
The status command shows basic information about the state of the firewall, as
well as rules managed via the \fBufw\fR command. It does not show rules from the
rules files in #CONFIG_PREFIX#/ufw. To see the complete state of the firewall,
users can \fBufw show raw\fR.  This displays the filter, nat, mangle and raw
tables using:

  iptables \-n \-L \-v \-x \-t <table>
  ip6tables \-n \-L \-v \-x \-t <table>

See the \fBiptables\fR and \fBip6tables\fR documentation for more details.
.PP
If the default policy is set to REJECT, \fBufw\fR may interfere with rules
added outside of the ufw framework. See README for details.
.PP
IPv6 is blocked by default only IPv6 traffic on the loopback interface is
allowed. To change this behavior, set IPV6 to 'yes' in
#CONFIG_PREFIX#/defaults/ufw and reload \fBufw\fR. Once IPv6 is enabled,
you may specify rules in the same way as for IPv4 rules, and they will be
displayed with \fBufw status\fR. Rules that match both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
apply to both IP versions. For example, when IPv6 is enabled, the following
rule will allow access to port 22 for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic:

  ufw allow 22

.PP
In addition to the command-line interface, \fBufw\fR also provides a
framework which allows administrators to take full advantage of netfilter.
See the \fBufw-framework\fR manual page for more information.
