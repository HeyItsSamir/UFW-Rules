.SH "RULE SYNTAX"
.PP
Users can specify rules using either a simple syntax or a full syntax. The
simple syntax only specifies the port and optionally the protocol to be
allowed or denied on the host. For example:

  ufw allow 53

This rule will allow tcp and udp port 53 to any address on this host. To
specify a protocol, append '/protocol' to the port. For example:

  ufw allow 25/tcp

This will allow tcp port 25 to any address on this host. \fBufw\fR will also
check /etc/services for the port and protocol if specifying a service by name.
Eg:

  ufw allow smtp
.PP
Users can also use a fuller syntax, specifying the source and destination
addresses and ports. This syntax is based on OpenBSD's PF syntax. For example:

  ufw deny proto tcp to any port 80

This will deny all traffic to tcp port 80 on this host. Another example:

  ufw deny proto tcp from 10.0.0.0/8 to 192.168.0.1 port 25

This will deny all traffic from the RFC1918 Class A network to tcp port 25
with the address 192.168.0.1.

  ufw deny proto tcp from 2001:db8::/32 to any port 25

This will deny all traffic from the IPv6 2001:db8::/32 to tcp port 25 on this
host. Note that IPv6 must be enabled in #CONFIG_PREFIX#/default/ufw for IPv6
firewalling to work.

  ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 80,443,8080:8090

This will allow all traffic to tcp ports 80, 443 and 8080-8090 inclusive. Note
that when specifying multiple ports, the ports list must be numeric, cannot
contain spaces and must be modified as a whole. Eg, in the above example you
cannot later try to delete just the '443' port. You cannot specify more than 15
ports (ranges count as 2 ports, so the port count in the above example is 4).
.PP
\fBufw\fR supports connection rate limiting, which is useful for protecting
against brute-force login attacks. \fBufw\fR will deny connections if an IP
address has attempted to initiate 6 or more connections in the last 30 seconds.
See http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/187 for details.  Typical
usage is:

  ufw limit ssh/tcp

.PP
To delete a rule, simply prefix the original rule with \fBdelete\fR. For
example, if the original rule was:

  ufw deny 80/tcp

Use this to delete it:

  ufw delete deny 80/tcp

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Deny all access to port 53:

  ufw deny 53

.PP
Allow all access to tcp port 80:

  ufw allow 80/tcp

.PP
Allow all access from RFC1918 networks to this host:

  ufw allow from 10.0.0.0/8
  ufw allow from 172.16.0.0/12
  ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16

.PP
Deny access to udp port 514 from host 1.2.3.4:

  ufw deny proto udp from 1.2.3.4 to any port 514

.PP
Allow access to udp 1.2.3.4 port 5469 from 1.2.3.5 port 5469:

  ufw allow proto udp from 1.2.3.5 port 5469 to 1.2.3.4 port 5469

.SH REMOTE MANAGEMENT
.PP
When running \fBufw enable\fR or starting \fBufw\fR via its initscript, 
\fBufw\fR will flush its chains. This is required so \fBufw\fR can maintain a
consistent state, but it may drop existing connections (eg ssh). \fBufw\fR
does support adding rules before enabling the firewall, so administrators can
do:

  ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 22

before running '\fBufw enable\fR'. The rules will still be flushed, but the
ssh port will be open after enabling the firewall. Please note that once
ufw is 'enabled', \fBufw\fR will not flush the chains when adding or removing
rules (but will when modifying a rule or changing the default policy).

.SH APPLICATION INTEGRATION
.PP
\fBufw\fR supports application integration by reading profiles located in
#CONFIG_PREFIX#/ufw/applications.d. To list the names of applications known to
\fBufw\fR, use:

  ufw app list

Users can specify one of the applications names when adding rules. For example,
when using the simple syntax, users can use:

  ufw allow <name>

Or for the extended syntax:

  ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16 to any app <name>

You should not specify the protocol with either syntax, and with the extended
syntax, use \fBapp\fR in place of the \fBport\fR clause.

Details on the firewall profile for a given application can be seen with:

  ufw app info <name>

where '<name>' is one of the applications seen with the \fFapp list\fR command.
User's may also specify \fBall\fR to see the profiles for all known
applications.

After creating or editing an application profile, user's can run:

  ufw app refresh <name>

This command will automatically update the firewall with the new profile
information. The behavior of the \fBrefresh\fB command can be configured using:

  ufw app default <policy>

The default application policy is \fBskip\fB, which means that the refresh
option will do nothing. Users may also specify a policy of \fBallow\fB or
\fBdeny\fR so the \fBrefresh\fB command may automatically update the firewall.
\fBWARNING\fR it may be a security to risk to use a default \fBallow\fR policy
for applications profiles. Carefully consider the security ramifications before
using a default \fBallow\fR policy.

.SH NOTES
.PP
On installation, \fBufw\fR is disabled with a default policy of deny.
.PP
Rule ordering is important and the first match wins. Therefore when adding
rules, add the more specific rules first with more general rules later.
.PP
\fBufw\fR is not intended to provide complete firewall functionality via
its command interface, but instead provides an easy way to add or remove
simple rules. It is currently mainly used for host-based firewalls.
.PP
The status command shows basic information about the state of the firewall, as
well as rules managed via the \fBufw\fR command. It does not show rules from the
rules files in #CONFIG_PREFIX#/ufw. To see the complete state of the firewall,
users can use:

  iptables -n -L
  ip6tables -n -L

See the \fBiptables\fR and \fBip6tables\fR documentation for more details.
.PP
Currently, \fBufw\fR is a front-end for \fBiptables-restore\fR, with its
rules saved in #CONFIG_PREFIX#/ufw/before.rules, #CONFIG_PREFIX#/ufw/after.rules
and #STATE_PREFIX#/user.rules. Administrators can customize \fBbefore.rules\fR
and \fBafter.rules\fR as desired using the standard \fBiptables-restore\fR
syntax. Rules are evaluated as follows: \fBbefore.rules\fR first,
\fBuser.rules\fR next, and \fBafter.rules\fR last. IPv6 rules are evaluated in
the same way, with the rules files named \fBbefore6.rules\fR, \fBuser6.rules\fR
and \fBafter6.rules\fR. Please note that \fBufw status\fR only shows rules
added with \fBufw\fR and not the rules found in the #CONFIG_PREFIX#/ufw rules
files.
.PP
\fBufw\fR will read in #CONFIG_PREFIX#/ufw/sysctl.conf on boot when enabled.
Please note that #CONFIG_PREFIX#/ufw/sysctl.conf overrides values in the
system systcl.conf (usually #CONFIG_PREFIX#/sysctl.conf).  To change this
behavior, modify #CONFIG_PREFIX#/default/ufw.
