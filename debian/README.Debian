ufw
---
On installation, ufw is not automatically enabled. To load the firewall and
enable it on boot, run:

# ufw enable

See 'man ufw' and README for more information.


Upgrading
---------
It is important to note that to properly support remote users, the firewall
will not be automatically restarted during upgrades. After an upgrade, either
reboot or perform:

# /etc/init.d/ufw restart

Please note that the above command will briefly open the firewall before
reloading the rules.


Preseeding
----------
ufw has support for preseeding. To enable a default deny firewall, add to your
preseed file:

ufw ufw/enable boolean true

And to allow a service, use:
ufw ufw/allow_known_ports multiselect SSH, WWW

Currently, ufw knows about the following services:
 Cups		# tcp and udp port 631
 DNS		# tcp and udp port 53
 Imap (Secure)	# tcp port 993
 Pop3 (Secure)	# tcp port 995
 SSH		# tcp port 22
 Samba		# udp ports 137, 138 and tcp ports 139, 445
 Smtp		# tcp port 25
 WWW		# tcp port 80
 WWW (Secure)	# tcp port 443

These ports are not associated with application profiles. Support for custom
ports is planned.
